# [Correlated Learning for Aggregation Systems](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/verma20a/verma20a.pdf)
In the paper we propose Correlated Learning (CL) algorithm which focuses on the problem of serving individual interests, i.e., learning policies for individuals in homogeneous multi-agent environment in the presence
of a self interested central entity. This repository implements traffic game example used in the paper. Traffic game is a stateless coordination game motivated by traffic control task where players need to select a route such that they do not cause congestion.

Dependencies
1. Python 3
2. tensorflow 

To run the experiment
$ python3 environment.py
